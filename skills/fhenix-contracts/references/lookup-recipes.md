# Lookup recipes — fhenix-contracts

This file teaches Claude how to find current information about FHE.sol and Fhenix on-chain behavior. **Always prefer live lookup over recall** — the on-chain library evolves and your training data may be stale.

## Find a function in FHE.sol

### Option A: User has cofhe-contracts installed locally

```
grep -nE "function <name>" node_modules/@fhenixprotocol/cofhe-contracts/contracts/FHE.sol
```

This matches the user's exact pinned version — the most authoritative answer.

### Option B: Fetch from the public repo

The `main` branch reflects the latest published API. Use `WebFetch` (not `Read` — the file is large; never read it whole).

URL pattern:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FhenixProtocol/cofhe-contracts/main/contracts/FHE.sol
```

After fetching, grep within the response for the function or type. Quote ~10-20 lines around the match. Do not paste the whole file into context.

## Find op semantics (does it revert? overflow behavior?)

The cofhe-contracts test suite exercises edge cases. Tests live under `contracts/internal/host-chain/test/`:

```
gh api repos/FhenixProtocol/cofhe-contracts/contents/contracts/internal/host-chain/test
```

Browse the directory (subdirs: `decryptResult`, `onChain`, `publiclyAllowed`, etc.), find the test file that matches your op, then `WebFetch` the raw file and read the relevant cases.

## Find ACL behavior (allowThis vs allowSender vs allowTransient)

The runtime semantics live in `TaskManager.sol` and `ACL.sol`. **Don't hardcode the path — these have moved before.** Find them by name from the live tree:

```
gh api repos/FhenixProtocol/cofhe-contracts/git/trees/main?recursive=1 \
  | jq -r '.tree[] | select(.path | endswith("TaskManager.sol") or endswith("ACL.sol")) | .path'
```

Then `WebFetch` whatever path comes back, against the `main` branch raw URL:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FhenixProtocol/cofhe-contracts/main/<path-from-above>
```

These hold the runtime logic that the user-facing `FHE.*` wrappers expose.

## Find the version you're targeting

```
# Local
cat node_modules/@fhenixprotocol/cofhe-contracts/package.json | grep '"version"'

# Remote — latest release
WebFetch https://api.github.com/repos/FhenixProtocol/cofhe-contracts/releases/latest
```

Use `WebFetch` against the relevant file (`main` branch + named-target grep) when quoting from these.

## When the docs site is sparse

`https://cofhe-docs.fhenix.zone` covers concepts but not exhaustive API reference. For API specifics, prefer the source (`cofhe-contracts/FHE.sol`) over the docs site.

## Deprecated symbols — if you find them, the doc is stale

These appear in older blog posts and docs but are **removed** from current `FHE.sol`. If a recipe surfaces them, treat the source as outdated:

- `FHE.decrypt(ct)` — the legacy synchronous-decrypt initiator. Current flow is off-chain `decryptForTx(...).execute()` + on-chain `FHE.verifyDecryptResult(...)`.
- `FHE.getDecryptResultSafe(ct)` — the polling pair to the legacy initiator. No longer needed; `decryptForTx().execute()` awaits to completion.

If you see either symbol in a fetched doc or example, switch to the current pattern (`allowPublic` / `allow(ct, user)` on-chain, `decryptForTx` / `decryptForView` off-chain). See `concepts/encrypted-input.md` and the SDK skill (`fhenix-sdk/references/concepts/decrypt-view-vs-tx.md`) for the canonical shape.
